<h1>CV - Project</h1>
<hr>

<p>This project was created as part of The Odin Project's cirriculum. This uses React.js, TailwindCSS and assorted react packages to be able to create a fully formed CV. </p>
<p>This project uses React functional components, with useState, useEffect and useRef in order to manage state within the project. There is no useContext yet, but this will be used in the next project, which will be a re-do of my exiting Weather Hazard Map, which has been originaly completed with vanilla JS.</p>
